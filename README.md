👋 Hi there! I'm Muhammad Idrees Khan, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast crafting my path towards excellence. 🚀 Pursuing a bachelor's degree in this thrilling field, I've built a strong foundation in network security, web app pentesting, ethical hacking, malware analysis, and more. With an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I continuously expand my skills through hands-on CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions and engaging security research projects. 🔍

Beyond the classroom, I've had the privilege of interning at ThincsCorp and SenseLearner Technologies, where I delved into Web Security, Network Security, vulnerability management, and compliance assessments. 💻 Equipped with proficiency in C/C++, Python, Bash, and SQL, I enjoy automating security tasks and developing secure applications that make a positive impact. Additionally, my leadership roles in university societies have nurtured my collaboration, project management, and strategic planning abilities. 🌟

While I take pride in my accomplishments, I remain humble and grounded, recognizing that there's always more to learn in this ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. With a passion for protecting digital frontiers and a drive to continually grow, I'm excited to embark on new challenges and contribute to a safer online world. 🙌
